# ToDo List
- [ ] create a `set_constant()` in a `custom_backend` that would allow user to update the constant dynamically from the ui (for example to set the number of semesters)
  - [x] all tests passed for the custom_backend
  - [x] does set_constant work in the ui?
  - [ ] ensure that the input is only integer
